They avoid some of the problems      encountered with other file formats, such as endianness, padding bytes, or differences in the number of bytes in a          machine word. Text files are used to store data more user friendly. Binary files stores data more compactly. Text file      are more restrictive than binary files. So when you have to save accurate & more confidential data we have to binary        file  ]"

I see no need to take up the space of using eight bit per value when I       only need three."

If you open the file in normal read mode, readline()        will return you the string. Use strip() and the restrip() method to read a line without newline in python.The strip()      method in Python helps in omitting the spaces that are present at the beginning (leading) and at the end (trailing).        Besides white spaces, the strip() method also includes the newline characters."
